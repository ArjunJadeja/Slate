## Tech stack

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Modern, concise and safe programming language.
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - A flow is a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCY67QzxA6Cz37o9j1oj1or45ioimGclfE1lR3eeMl3wbH8xQU8mvoQaAiMZEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) - A concurrency design pattern to execute code asynchronously.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - Navigation - Implements navigation from simple button clicks to more complex patterns.
  - ViewBinding - Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
  - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - LiveData - LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
  - Datastore - DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers.
  - Room - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/util/DiffUtil) - DiffUtil is a utility class that can calculate the difference between two lists and output a list of update operations that converts the first list into the second one.
- [Material You](https://m3.material.io) - Material design components for building View layouts and Animations.
- [MVVM Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCYdinWTjLF0pkdfD6ZyjFwCOjjzX0m7l-tOgXWL-spDqHtFWLgNE80aAoi3EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds#recommended-app-arch) - MVVM architecture is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component.
